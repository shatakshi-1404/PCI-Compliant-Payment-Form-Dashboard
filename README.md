# PCI-Compliant-Payment-Form-Dashboard
The PCI-Compliant Payment Form & Dashboard
This project shows you understand the user-facing, secure, and accessible side of payments, which is just as important as the backend.


Front-End Mastery: Directly showcases HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Responsive Design.

Security & Compliance Focus: Talking about PCI-DSS compliance, even at a basic level, is a massive differentiator for a payment company.

UX/UI Excellence: Demonstrates User-Centered Design, Usability, and Accessibility (WCAG)â€”all explicitly mentioned in the JD.


The Secure Payment Form:

Build a responsive form that collects card number, expiry, CVV, and name.

Do NOT actually process real payments. Use a client-side validation library or mock a successful response.

Crucial: Implement best practices for security. This is your talking point:

Clearly state "This is a demo. No real data is sent to any server."

Explain that a real implementation would use a PCI-DSS compliant payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, Braintree) so sensitive data never touches your server.

This shows you understand the concept of compliance, which is incredibly valuable.

The Admin Dashboard:

Build a second view that displays "processed" transactions. Fetch data from a mock API you create with Node.js/Express or Python/Flask.

Focus on UX: Make this dashboard incredibly clear and usable. Use charts (with Chart.js or similar) to visualize approval rates, transaction volumes, etc.

Focus on Accessibility: Use semantic HTML, ARIA labels, ensure high color contrast, and full keyboard navigation. Test it with a screen reader.

Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript (ES6+), React (Optional but great), Node.js/Express, Chart.js.

"Developed a PCI-DSS compliant payment form demo with a focus on user experience, security best practices, and accessibility (WCAG 2.1)."

"Designed and implemented a responsive admin dashboard with data visualization, prioritizing usability and a clear information hierarchy for decision-making."

"Built a RESTful API with Node.js to serve mock transaction data to the front-end dashboard."
